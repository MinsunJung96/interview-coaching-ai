# CRITICAL ANIMATION SETTINGS - DO NOT MODIFY

These settings are essential for animations to work properly:

1. `const isClient = useClientOnly();` - MUST BE ACTIVE (line 136)
2. `if (!isClient) hydration check` - MUST BE ACTIVE (around line 1778)  
3. All Step 0 animation useEffects - MUST BE ACTIVE
4. digitAnimations, activeListItems states - MUST BE ACTIVE

Last working backup available in: src/app/page.tsx.working-backup-*

## Recovery Steps if animations break:
1. Check if useClientOnly is commented out
2. Check if hydration check is commented out  
3. Restore from working backup if needed
